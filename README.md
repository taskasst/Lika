# Lika
Lika is a casual atmospheric side-scrolling mobile game where you guide leaves through the four seasons to restore color and balance to the forest.
You play as wind, blowing the leaves through obstacles and interacting with the environment.
Your goal is to collect all the leaves in each season and safely transport them to the end of the level, where they are then given to the Great Tree.

My contributions to this project included working on the leaf movement collaboratively with another programmer.
The movement utilizes vector fields that increase on swipe and decrease over time.
I also worked on the coding for both of the windmills, the rock interactions, leaf collection, music track addition and subtraction, audio implementation, and snowman interaction.

This project was developed using C# in Unity.
